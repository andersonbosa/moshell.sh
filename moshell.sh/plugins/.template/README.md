 # Plugin Template

This is a template for creating plugins for your Shellscript-based framework. This template provides a basic structure and guidelines to help you get started with developing new plugins quickly.

## Structure

The template follows a standard structure for plugins, with the following files and directories:

- `_index.sh`: A script that provides to Moshell.sh how to boot the plugin.
- `plugin.sh`: The main plugin script that contains the core functionality of the plugin.

You can add more files like `.env` and other things, just keep in mind that you always need to work with the **absolute path** when importing your.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the template repository.
2. Rename the directory to match the name of your plugin.
3. Code your plugin's functionality in `plugin.sh`.
4. Customize the `README.md` file to describe your plugin, its features, and how to use it.
5. Create a Issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andersonbosa/moshell.sh) **to share your plugin** with the Moshell.sh community.

## Plugin Development Guidelines
