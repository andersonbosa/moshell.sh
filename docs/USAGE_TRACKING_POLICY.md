# Usage Tracking Notice

Dear Users,

We value your privacy and want to ensure you have a clear understanding of how we handle data in our application. We are introducing a simple usage tracking initiative to better understand how our application is being used. Please take a moment to review the information below.


## Purpose of Data Collection:

The collected data will help us understand how often our application is being used and the general patterns of usage. This information will aid us in making improvements and enhancements to the application based on user behavior.

#### Your Options:

- Opt-In: By continuing to use the application, you are agreeing to participate in our usage tracking initiative. We appreciate your support in helping us improve the application.
- Opt-Out: If you prefer not to participate, you can easily opt out of usage tracking. Simply update the flag `_MOSHELL_FLAG_ENABLE_TRACKING_SERVICE` below and your usage data will not be collected. But if you want to participate without informing the data generated for hash id (see [What Data We Collect](#what-data-we-collect)), you can only disable this functionality with the flag`_MOSHELL_FLAG_ENABLE_TRACKING_FINGERPRINT`
  
Available flags:
  - `_MOSHELL_FLAG_ENABLE_TRACKING_SERVICE` - 0/1 - Disable/enables tracking service
  - `_MOSHELL_FLAG_ENABLE_TRACKING_FINGERPRINT` - 0/1 - Disable/enables the use of non-sensitive information when generating Hash to the user ID


## What Data We Collect:

We will collect basic usage data each time the application is initialized. As part of our usage tracking, we generate a unique identifier (ID) for each instance of the App when is initialized. This ID is generated by hashing certain **non-sensitive** system information using the **SHA-256** algorithm. The collected data consists of this hashed ID, so we do not know the system details.
> See more about Hash Functions in: [data security section](#data-security)

## Data Collected:

The following non-sensitive system information is used to generate the hashed ID:

- Hostname
- CPU Information
- Total RAM
- OS Version
- Kernel Version
- Username

## Data Security:

The generated hashed ID is a **one-way hash and cannot be reversed to reveal the original system information**. No personal, sensitive, or identifiable data is collected. The hashed ID ensures that your privacy is maintained while allowing us to gain insights into overall application usage.

## Data Privacy:

We take data privacy seriously. The collected data will be stored securely and will only be used for the stated purposes. No personal or sensitive information will be collected, and the data will be processed in accordance with our privacy policy.

Thank you for your continued support and for being part of our community. If you have any questions or concerns about our usage tracking initiative, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at this [contact][linkedin].
